The raw data folder contains original run files form Roche Lightcycler 96. Each file was named by the project name, analyzed tissue, gene name and the annealing tempreture.

The newly snythesized cDNA of sample PI60 was not diluted. Hence, it was not One extra qPCR assay was run to get its Cq values of the reference genes together with 3 extra samples for the calculation of inter-plate calibration factor. The assay was run in triplate and the calibration factor was calculated fllowing the method of Hellemans et al., 2007. The detailed calculation can be found in the file calibration.csv.
