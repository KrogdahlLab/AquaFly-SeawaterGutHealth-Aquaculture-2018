The newly snythesized cDNA of sample PI60 was not diluted. Hence, the cDNA template was not added during the plate set-up on the Biomek4000 automation workstation. One extra qPCR assay (AqFl2_PI60_RefGenes_ann temp 60) was run to get its Cq values of the reference genes together with 3 extra samples for the calculation of inter-plate calibration factor. The assay was run in triplate and the calibration factor was calculated following the method of Hellemans et al., 2007. The detailed calculation can be found in the file *Interplate_calibration.xlsx* under the "./data/clean_data" folder.
